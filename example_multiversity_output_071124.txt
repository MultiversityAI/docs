Initial Response:
Before we discuss the answer choices, let's break down the question a bit. The question is asking about which human cells contain a gene that specifies eye color. To approach this question, it might be helpful to consider where genetic information is stored in the human body and how it is passed on.

Could you explain your initial thoughts on where genetic information is stored in human cells and how it determines specific traits like eye color? This might help us better understand which cells could contain a gene for eye color.
